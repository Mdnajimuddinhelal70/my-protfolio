      The "Medicine Management System" is a full-stack web application designed to streamline the process of purchasing and managing medicines. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and enhanced by technologies like Firebase, JWT, and Stripe for authentication and secure payment, the platform provides a seamless experience for both users and administrators.

      Key features include:

      - Role-based Access Control: Admins can manage users by assigning roles like "Admin", "Seller", or "User". Sellers can add and manage their medicines, while users can browse, select, and purchase medicines.
      - Secure Payment Integration: Users can purchase medicines through secure transactions using Stripe.
      - Admin Privileges: Admins have the ability to promote or demote users and manage all aspects of the platform, including sales reports and advertisements.
      - Responsive Design: The interface is crafted using Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI for a modern, user-friendly experience across devices.
      - State Management: Efficient data handling and caching are achieved using TanStack Query and Axios.`,
